# Open-listings

## For Hacktoberfest contributions, please read carefully !!

- Mainly, every contribution is welcome; From basic code review (refactoring / coding style), to design (CSS / Layout / design) to bug fixes. I expect you to show effort opening either an issue or a pull request though.
- I am not developping new features, unless proven very necessary.
- Please, as I said every contribution is welcome; If you want to deploy this on your local machine to develop, I expect you to show effort deploying it, before raising any issue on how to deploy it. Read README for this.
